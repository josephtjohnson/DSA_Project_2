Description:
This problem required the same operation to be performed until all directories had been searched.
Because of this, recursion was the ideal candidate. This algorithm takes in the file extension being
sought along with the path and returns a list of file names located in the directory and all subdirectories.



Time complexity: 
This function is being called n times until the base case is reached where n is equal to the number
of directories to traverse. This gives us a time complexity of O(n).

 
Space complexity:
This function will also be O(n) as data structure creation and memory usage are completely dependent
upon the number of directories being traversed.
