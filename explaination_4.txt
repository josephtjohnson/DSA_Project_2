Description:
To solve this issue we make use of the list data structure. This allows us to easily traverse each
item in the data structure. Because we are performing an operation on lists nested within other lists,
recursion became the clear choice.


Time complexity: 
This algorithm is entirely dependent upon the size of the class variables within the group being evaluated.
Because is depends upon input size this time complexity would result in O(n).

 
Space complexity:
The space complexity for this algorithm is consistent with how many times it is called (m) but does not
create data structures depending on input size O(1). Thus the space complexity results in O(m).
